# üéØ Objective

The primary objective of this project is to process and transform raw Spotify Discover Weekly playlist data into structured formats for generating valuable insights and dashboards. This project aims to simplify handling large-scale playlist data and provide meaningful, actionable insights.

# üõ† Current Problem and How This Project Solves It

### Problem:
Data engineering workflows often face challenges such as:
- Inconsistent data formats.
- High costs associated with data processing and visualization tools.
- Lack of automation for transforming raw data into insights.

### Solution:
This project addresses these issues by:
- Implementing Python-based ETL pipelines to process raw JSON data into clean CSV files.
- Using cost-effective solutions like AWS S3 for data storage and Power BI for visualization, ensuring minimal or no expenses.
- Automating the transformation and visualization process to reduce manual intervention.
